Future Ideas
------------

- Keep decent logs. E.g., prompt the users at the end of the session for a
  string describing what went on, then maybe snapshot the shell history plus
  any git commits into a single place for later reference.

- Hackivate. For example, you could make a Kibitz Mode that announces the
  session (on Twitter, IRC, etc.), then netizens worldwide can log into
  wemux's readonly "Mirror" mode, then their comments appear in a sub-window.
  Should be easy to privilege them as read-write mode to invite them to drive.
  Could go nuts with this angle - for example, a company could sponsor a
  hackathon where there are tasks to grab, and you pair up do-si-do style with
  whoever might be available... maybe even have a contest aspect to it (such
  as winning points per task - or taking an existing codebase and trying to
  get as many "-" diffs as possible in refactoring.)

- Transportable sessions. E.g., you've got some good project going on,
  everything is set up, then you decide it would be smart to check it out on a
  machine that has a Windows VM. Instead of scratching your head figuring out
  how to install one, you zap the pair session over to some other host that
  already has one set up. In fact, I wonder if there's anything in the
  licenses that would prevent these hosts from being completely communal -- if
  not, you could make a slew of sandboxes ready to go -- everything from
  Windows 95 to 8, OSX Lion/Sabrecat/Meowbot3000, even maybe toss in some
  badly-configured ones, like filled with browser toolbars and spyware.

- Really good I/O with other machines - Of course pre-installed
  `gist`/`wgetpaste` CLI stuff, but also a way to get `xclip`/`xsel` talking
  with the host machine, perhaps add init prompts to do the `.ssh/id\_rsa.pub`
  exchange so that `scp` is quick both ways.

- Automate process of:
    - Creating Stackato user for pair guy
    - email/github/irc/twitter? invites

- Add mosh (MObile SHell)

Things to Check
---------------

- Why does the stackato group show up as 1034 in /app/fs/home/
